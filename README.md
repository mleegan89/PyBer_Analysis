# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis given to us by V. Isualize was to create a summary of ride-sharing data by city type. We were also asked to create a visual representation of this data. 

### Resources
 - Python
 - Matplotlib
 - city_data.csv
 - ride_data.csv

## Results

After looking at the table shown above, we can determine that urban cities consistently had more total fares than suburban and rural cities. While the number of fares fluctuated weekly, the difference between the three city types remained consistent.

When we took a further look at the data, we were able to determine that urban cities average the least $$ amount per ride and per driver by a significant margin. As a rural driver, there may be fewer fares available but the opportuntiy to earn more per fare is certainly an advantage to completing fares/drives in urban cities. It was also imporantt to note that in urban cities not every driver was able to actually complete a fare/ride due to the high number of drivers.

## Summary
Based on the analysis conducted and results shown above we can make three business recommendations:
1. Decrease total number of drivers in urban cities. There are currently more drivers than rides available to service. We would also keep a close eye on the suburban cities to make sure that the rides - drivers correlation does not increase further. 
2. Increase awareness of your service in rural and suburban cities. These are the cities that are generating the greatest Average Fare per Ride & Driver. Increasing the number of rides in these two types of cities will greatly improve business performance. 
3. Monitor performance on a weekly basis and rotate drivers to the city types that need assistance the most. This will not only improve business performance but ensure your drivers are making more per ride leading to greater employee satisfaction.
